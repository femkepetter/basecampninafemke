# The Witcher quiz
## About
CodeGorilla Basecamp project made by Nina Aurora and Femke Petter. This was our first group-project and we had a lot of fun making it. Nina Aurora did the front-end of this project and Femke Petter the back-end code. 

It has a few things that could be made a little bit better/smoother, and also the coding itself could be a bit more neat, but we decided to share the project as it is. That way our learning curve during the bootcamp is much more clear.

## Installation and seeding the database

To make it work on your computer you need Node.JS, NPM and MongoDB. In your terminal - go to the directory where te project is stored. 

If everything is installed follow these steps to make the project work:
1. sudo systemctl status mongoDB
2. npm install

To seed your MongoDB database:

2. node public/js/questions.js

Start the server with nodemon, go to localhost:3000 and have fun!
